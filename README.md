# simple-Artificial-Neural-Network-model

used dataset : Mobile_Price_Classification.csv (attached)

steps :

  --> Read the data in CSV file
  --> Split the data set into training and testing data where it contains 75% of the data as training and rest as testing data
  --> Ann model architecture: â€“ You can have the ANN with 2 hidden layer
          1stlayer with 8 neurons/nodes
          2nd layer with 4 neurons/nodes
  --> Compile the model 
  --> Fit, train the model for 100 epoch with batch size of 32
  --> Save the weights file.
